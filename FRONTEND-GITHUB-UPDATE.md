# ðŸ“‹ MANUAL GITHUB UPDATE PROCESS

Since the repository name is not matching, here's how to update your GitHub repository manually with the correct code:

## STEP 1: Download the Complete Package
I've prepared all the correct files at: `/tmp/complete-github-update.tar.gz`

## STEP 2: Get the Files From Replit
1. In this Replit, go to Files panel
2. Navigate to `/tmp/`  
3. Download `complete-github-update.tar.gz` (469KB)

## STEP 3: Update Your GitHub Repository
1. Extract the downloaded file on your computer
2. Open your GitHub repository in web browser
3. For each folder (server/, client/, shared/):
   - Delete the old folder
   - Upload the new folder from extracted files
4. Update these root files:
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json  
   - vite.config.ts
   - tsconfig.json
   - tailwind.config.ts
   - drizzle.config.ts

## STEP 4: Verify the Key Changes
Make sure these critical files are updated:
- `server/storage.ts` - Should have `export const storage = new DatabaseStorage()`
- `server/production.ts` - Should return `rights` not `role`
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Should have complete ThorEye routing

## STEP 5: Expected Result
After GitHub update, your Render deployment will show:
- Complete ThorEye dashboard (not basic login)
- Full admin access (not "Access Denied")
- Database users: admin + Abhishek
- All forms, reports, and features working

The issue is simply that your GitHub has old code while this Replit has the correct working version.
