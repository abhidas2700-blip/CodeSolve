I already have an Audit Tool with:

Form Builder (Admin/Team Lead can create forms)

User Management (roles exist)

Audit Module (auditors fill audits, publish reports, data, etc.)

👉 Now I need to add a Partner role + full rebuttal workflow.

🔑 User Roles

Admin → Full control, sees everything.

Manager → Can view all audits, handle rebuttals.

Team Lead (TL) → Can re-audit, edit audits, accept/reject rebuttals.

Auditor → Performs audits using published forms, selects Partner.

Partner → Can view only their assigned audits, raise rebuttals and re-rebuttals.

📝 Form Builder Update

Only Admin or Team Lead can create forms.

While creating a form:

Add a Partner dropdown field.

Dropdown values come from User Management (role = Partner).

Publish form → available to Auditors for use.

📝 Audit Update

When an Auditor performs an audit using a form:

They must select a Partner from the Partner dropdown.

Submit audit → this links the audit with the chosen Partner.

That Partner will now see this audit in their dashboard.

🔄 Rebuttal Workflow

Partner Review

Partner logs in → sees audits assigned to them.

If not satisfied → raise a Rebuttal by adding a note.

Audit status → Under Rebuttal.

Notifications go to TL, Manager, Admin.

Rebuttal Handling (by TL/Manager/Admin)

They re-audit the case:

If error found → edit audit & mark Rebuttal Accepted.

If no issue → mark Rebuttal Rejected.

Partner gets notified of decision.

Re-Rebuttal (second chance by Partner)

If Partner still disagrees, they can raise a Re-Rebuttal.

TL/Manager/Admin review again.

Options:

Accept → Edit audit, mark accepted.

Reject → Mark rejected.

After this stage, the audit becomes locked.

📂 Rebuttal Section

Add a Rebuttal Section in the system.

This section should show:

All audits that have rebuttals raised.

Rejected rebuttals → still visible here for tracking.

Re-Rebuttals → appear in the same section with status.

Roles that can see Rebuttal Section: Admin, Manager, TL.

Partners see only their own rebuttals under their audit view.
