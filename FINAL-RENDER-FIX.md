# üéØ FINAL STEP: Fix GitHub Static Path

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Render deployment: **SUCCESSFUL** at https://codesolve.onrender.com
- ‚úÖ Backend API: **WORKING** (health check responds)
- ‚úÖ Database: **CONNECTED** to Neon PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Authentication: **OPERATIONAL**
- ‚è≥ Frontend: **Needs 1-line fix in GitHub**

## The Issue
Replit has the correct static path, but GitHub still has the old path. Render deploys from GitHub.

## The Fix
In your **GitHub repository**, edit `server/production.ts` line 145:

**Change from:**
```typescript
const staticPath = path.join(__dirname, "..", "public");
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
const staticPath = path.join(__dirname, "public");
```

## Why This Works
- Build creates `dist/public/` (frontend files)
- Server runs from `dist/production.js`
- So `__dirname` = `dist/`, making `dist/public` correct

## After Update
1. Push to GitHub
2. Render auto-deploys
3. Frontend works instantly
