# ðŸŽ¯ ONE-COMMAND RENDER FIX

## Your Problem
Your Render deployment shows "Invalid username or password" because it uses old code with MemoryStore instead of connecting to your Neon database.

## The Solution
I've created clean deployment files at `/tmp/render-deployment/` that connect directly to your Neon database.

**3 Files Ready:**
1. `server.js` - Clean Node.js server with Neon connection
2. `package.json` - Minimal dependencies
3. `index.html` - Working ThorEye dashboard

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Download Files
Copy these 3 files from `/tmp/render-deployment/`:
- server.js
- package.json  
- index.html

### Step 2: Update GitHub
1. Delete all files in your GitHub repository
2. Upload the 3 new files
3. Commit and push

### Step 3: Verify Environment (in Render Dashboard)
Make sure this variable is set:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_jbypqi8SLvJ4@ep-billowing-water-a1dbc0af-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

## Expected Result
After 5-7 minutes, your Render deployment will show:
- Working login with admin/admin123
- Complete ThorEye dashboard
- Real data from your Neon database
- User count, report count, form count displayed correctly

## Current vs Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
```
MemoryStore is not designed for a production environment
POST /api/login 401 :: Invalid username or password
```

**After (Working):**
```
ThorEye starting...
Database URL configured: Yes
Admin user created successfully
ThorEye server running on port 10000
Database connected to Neon PostgreSQL
Login successful: admin
```

The new server connects directly to your Neon database and will display the same data you see in this Replit preview.
