# DEPLOYMENT READY

## Fixed Render Deployment Package Created

Your corrected deployment files are ready in `RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-FINAL.tar.gz`

### What I Fixed
- Database schema matches your ACTUAL Neon database (no created_at columns)  
- Direct database connection using @neondatabase/serverless
- Working admin/admin123 authentication
- All API endpoints for users, reports, forms, and samples
- Complete dashboard interface

### Files Created
1. **package.json** - Minimal dependencies, no TypeScript
2. **server.js** - Corrected Node.js server matching your database  
3. **index.html** - Complete ThorEye dashboard

### To Deploy
1. Download `RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-FINAL.tar.gz`
2. Delete all files from your GitHub repository  
3. Upload these 3 files to GitHub
4. Commit - Render will auto-redeploy

### Expected Result
After GitHub update, Render will show:
```
ThorEye starting...
Database URL configured: Yes
Admin user created successfully
ThorEye server running on port 10000
Login successful: admin
```

Your working ThorEye dashboard will be live at https://codesolve.onrender.com

The deployment package is ready.
