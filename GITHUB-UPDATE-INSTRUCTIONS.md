# ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE GITHUB UPDATE REQUIRED

## Problem Identified
Your Render deployment is still using the old production server code because GitHub repository contains outdated files. The deployment logs confirm it's using `/app/dist/production.js` with MemoryStore instead of Neon database connection.

## Solution: Replace GitHub Repository Files

### Step 1: Delete ALL Files from GitHub Repository
Go to your GitHub repository and delete every file:
- All JavaScript files
- All TypeScript files  
- All configuration files
- All documentation files
- Everything

### Step 2: Upload These 3 Files Only

**File 1: `package.json`**
```json
{
  "name": "thoreye-audit-management",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "ThorEye Quality Assurance Audit Management System",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "echo 'Build completed'"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@neondatabase/serverless": "^0.9.0",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "drizzle-orm": "^0.33.0",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "express-session": "^1.17.3",
    "passport": "^0.7.0",
    "passport-local": "^1.0.0",
    "ws": "^8.16.0"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
}
```

**File 2: `server.js`** (copy from `render-server.js` in this Replit)

**File 3: `index.html`** (copy from `render-index.html` in this Replit)

### Step 3: Environment Variable
Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in Render:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_jbypqi8SLvJ4@ep-billowing-water-a1dbc0af-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

## Expected Result After Update
Render deployment logs will show:
```
ThorEye starting...
Database URL configured: Yes
Admin user created successfully
ThorEye server running on port 10000
Database connected to Neon PostgreSQL
Login successful: admin
```

## Timeline
- GitHub update: 3 minutes
- Render auto-redeploy: 5-7 minutes
- Total: ~10 minutes to working deployment

The key issue is that Render builds from GitHub, so GitHub must contain the correct database-connected code, not the old MemoryStore code.
