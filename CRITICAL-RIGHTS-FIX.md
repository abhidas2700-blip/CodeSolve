# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RIGHTS FIX - FOUND THE EXACT ISSUE

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Your screenshot shows "Access Denied" because the Render production server is returning:
```json
{"id":1,"username":"admin","role":user.role}
```

But the frontend expects:
```json
{"id":1,"username":"admin","rights":["admin","manager",...]}
```

## THE BUG
In `server/production.ts` line 159 and 177:
- Uses `role: user.role` instead of `rights: user.rights`
- This causes the frontend to see no permissions
- Frontend shows "Access Denied" for everything

## IMMEDIATE FIX FOR GITHUB
Replace these lines in `server/production.ts`:

**Login response (line 155-161):**
```typescript
res.json({ 
  user: { 
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    rights: user.rights  // Changed from role: user.role
  } 
});
```

**User info response (line 174-178):**
```typescript
res.json({ 
  id: user.id,
  username: user.username,
  rights: user.rights  // Changed from role: user.role
});
```

## EXPECTED RESULT
After this fix, login will return:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "admin",
    "rights": ["admin","manager","teamleader","audit","ata","reports","dashboard","buildForm","userManage","createLowerUsers","masterAuditor","debug","deleteForm","editForm","createForm","superAdmin"]
  }
}
```

And you'll have full access to all ThorEye features!

**This is a simple 2-line fix that will solve the Access Denied issue.**
